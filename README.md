## Project Overview
This repository documents the iterative design process for creating an **assistive device** as part of the ICD 12 final project. The project follows a structured timeline with phases including research, ideation, prototyping, testing, and final presentation.

**Objective:** Design and build a functional assistive device using recycled materials, laser cutting, 3D printing, and other available tools while adhering to the iterative design cycle.

## Timeline
| Phase | Dates (2025) | Key Activities |  
|-------|-------|----------------|  
| **Understanding Context & Defining** | March 13 - April 14 | Interviews, research, problem definition |  
| **Ideating/Prototyping/Testing** | April 16 - April 29 | Sketching, CAD modeling, prototyping, testing |  
| **Making/Testing** | May 6 - May 15 | Final fabrication, robust testing |  
| **Sharing** | May 27 - May 30 | Presentations, submission of reports |  

**Note:** Timeline is subject to change. POA (Point of Assessment) phases are marked in the original project plan.

## Deliverables
1. **Final Prototype** (3D-printed components)  
2. **Documentation** (photos, CAD files, testing notes)  
3. **Short Presentation** (5-minute in-class presentation)  
4. **Longer Report/Presentation** (submitted separately for assessment)  
5. **GitHub Repository** (this README + all design files)
